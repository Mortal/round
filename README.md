## Time until next power-of-two birthday

Given your birthday and a base (e.g. 2 for binary),
compute the next date your age is an integral power of the base
when measured in days.

For instance, when run on December 9, 2016 by someone whose birthday is July 21, 1990:

```
$ python round.py 1990-07-21 10
You are 9638 days old and will be 10**4 days on 2017-12-06
You are 832723200 seconds old and will be 10**9 seconds on 2022-03-29
You are 832723200000000 microseconds old and will be 10**15 microseconds on 2022-03-29
You are 832723200000 milliseconds old and will be 10**12 milliseconds on 2022-03-29
You are 231312 hours old and will be 10**6 hours on 2104-08-18
You are 13878720 minutes old and will be 10**8 minutes on 2180-09-06
You are 1377 weeks old and will be 10**4 weeks on 2182-03-16
```
