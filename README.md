## Time until next power-of-two birthday

Given your birthday and a base (e.g. 2 for binary),
compute the next date your age is an integral power of the base
when measured in days.

For instance, when run on November 28, 2016 by someone whose birthday is June 25, 1994:

```
$ python round.py 1994-06-25 2
You are 8192 days old. Happy birthday!
You are 196608 hours old and will be 2**18 hours on 2024-05-20
You are 11796480 minutes old and will be 2**24 minutes on 2026-05-18
You are 707788800 seconds old and will be 2**30 seconds on 2028-07-03
You are 707788800000 milliseconds old and will be 2**40 milliseconds on 2029-04-27
You are 707788800000000 microseconds old and will be 2**50 microseconds on 2030-02-27
You are 1170 weeks old and will be 2**11 weeks on 2033-09-24
```
